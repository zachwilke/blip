# Blip weekly contributor notes

Working notes for the PUBLIC weekly Blip update that @nixfred posts. One section
per ISO week, newest first. Notes go in the same turn the work lands, never
reconstructed on Sunday from memory.

**How these notes are kept (Fred, standing, 2026-09-18)**
- Every merged PR gets a line THE DAY IT MERGES: number, one sentence a
  non-contributor understands, the contributor's real name, and their X handle
  as a link when it is verified (rules and the verified list: `CHANGE.log`).
- Record what was actually verified and the real numbers, because that is what
  makes the post worth reading: measured before/after, tests run, what was NOT
  checked.
- Credit the reporter of a bug as well as its fixer.
- EVERY contributor is paired with an X account. If the lookup cannot verify
  one, ask Fred THE SAME DAY the PR merges (standing, 2026-09-18), never at
  post time: he often knows the person or can just ask them. Open questions
  live in "Handles Fred still needs to answer" below until they are answered.
- Anything a contributor should know that is not in the diff (a trade-off, a
  follow-up left open, a decision that went against their PR) goes here too.
- On Sunday the week's section becomes one post, drafted into `X-POSTS.md`, and
  the section is marked POSTED with the link. Nothing is posted by Larry; Fred
  reads and posts.
- A week with no merges still gets a section saying so. Silence is data.

## 2026-W41 (Mon 5 Oct to Sun 11 Oct): OPEN, post due Sun 11 Oct

### What people said this week (quote with attribution in the post)

- **Ian Swope** (https://x.com/ianfs), on #138, 7 Oct: "Thanks Fred, and
  thanks for Blip itself. I use it all day and really love it, so it's a
  pleasure to help where I can. Glad this one brought tapbacks back on your
  27.2 gateway too." Then found the cause of the silent tapback failure the
  same night and sent it as #139.
- **Damon Janis** (https://x.com/damonjanis), on #120, 7 Oct: "Happy to be
  tagged, I'm @damonjanis on X. Thanks for getting the whole series merged
  and deployed!" (His read-sync series #120, #121, #122 is complete.)
- **Brandon Smith** (https://x.com/bndnsmth), on #134, 7 Oct: "Appreciate
  the quick review and merge. Feel free to tag @bndnsmth in your post."
- Ian Swope sent six PRs this week (#133, #135, #136, #137, #138, #139),
  three of them the same evening, two of them closing review notes Larry
  left on his previous PR within the hour.

### Wed 7 Oct: #135, #136, #137, #138, #139

- **#139 a failed tapback is never silent.** Ian Swope (https://x.com/ianfs).
  A run takes 15-75 s on macOS 27; closing Blip meanwhile lost the reason.
  The run now lives in the bar widget and the failure waits for the chat.

- **#138 tapbacks on macOS 27.** Ian Swope (https://x.com/ianfs). Every
  tapback failed on a 27 gateway: no per-user TCC.db, and bubbles there
  offer no tapback actions. Now the permission is asked of macOS without a
  prompt, and the newest message is reacted to through Messages' own
  Tapback Picker, only after its label matches. Older messages are refused
  on 27. Fred's Mac is on 27.2: the check now passes there.

- **#137 the toast click no longer leaks unread state.** Ian Swope
  (https://x.com/ianfs), following the review note on #136: the reply is
  always "opened", so another program cannot learn which chats are unread.

- **#136 clicking a message toast opens the conversation.** Ian Swope
  (https://x.com/ianfs). With the default automation=off a click only
  dismissed it, because the toast ran the gated goto. A new IPC opens only
  chats Blip toasted or that are still unread, otherwise the list.

- **#135 the deploy line copies the menu icons.** Ian Swope
  (https://x.com/ianfs). The copy line in CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md and
  CONTRIBUTING.md left out icons/, so a by-the-book deploy showed the
  conversation menu without icons. Docs only.

### Tue 6 Oct: #133, #134

- **#133 a read survives a locked Mac.** Ian Swope (https://x.com/ianfs).
  A gateway Mac's screen saver locks it about 25 minutes after last use;
  Messages then has no reachable window, and after 5 failed tries the read
  was dropped and the dot came back (441 attempts in one night on his Mac).
  Per-chat reads now retry once a minute until the Mac confirms, and the
  error names the lock. His test change also fixed 15 read-sync tests that
  failed on any machine running the #83 warm channel.
- **#134 the sidebar shows which chat is open.** Brandon Smith
  (github.com/bndnsmth, new contributor; X https://x.com/bndnsmth, confirmed on the PR). In the two-pane window
  the highlight could sit on a different chat than the one shown. Verified
  live on gus with a screenshot: the open chat's tile stays selected with
  the mouse elsewhere.

## 2026-W40 (Mon 28 Sep to Sun 4 Oct): post missed 4 Oct, folded into Post 5 with W41 (Sun 11 Oct)

13 PRs merged so far, from 7 people (#131 cherry-picked).

### Sun 4 Oct: #127, #122, #83 merged; #131's Mac fix taken

All four were one-way doors (they change the Mac bridge or CI), which is
why they sat open: that rule means Fred reads the diff before merge, and
no session waives it. Fred approved each on 4 Oct.

- **#127 tapbacks can't land on the neighbouring message.** Erik
  Fillipsveen (github.com/Fileri). Testing #116 on macOS 26.6 he got a
  heart on the wrong message twice: scrolling renumbers transcript rows
  between the scroll and the press. Now a pass that scrolls never presses,
  label and frame are read in one event, no retry, stray check always.
  Tapbacks stay off on Fred's machines.
- **#122 Pin and Hide Alerts in the conversation menu.** Damon Janis
  (https://x.com/damonjanis). Through Messages' own menu, verified over the
  whole conversation cluster; the four review fixes were added on top by
  another Larry session. Completes the #120/#121/#122 series.
- **#83 a warm channel to the Mac.** Zach Wilke
  (https://x.com/zachwilke_1). A helper keeps the ssh link open: a poll
  query took a median 18 ms against 166 ms one-shot on gus, measured live.
  Killing the link on purpose: queries fell back with no errors and the bar
  restarted the helper within 30 s. Real Wi-Fi loss not tested.
- **#131 a send now waits for the Automation prompt.** David Benedic
  (github.com/daveyb, new contributor; X asked). imsg-send gave up after
  15 s, shorter than the Allow prompt; now 150 s. His Windows tray client
  was declined for this repo with an offer to link it as its own project.

### Sat 4 Oct: #128

- **#128 a sleeping monitor no longer crashes Hyprland a second way.** Brad
  Larson (github.com/followbl, X https://x.com/followbl), his second fix in
  this area: #113 stopped Blip mapping its window with no output; this stops
  it MOVING the window home while the only monitor is gone, which hit the same
  null-monitor segfault in Hyprland 0.56 (symbolized core from his own crash on
  2 Oct, reproduced in a nested Hyprland). The move now waits for a real
  output; the bug is in Hyprland and still unguarded on their main. Verified:
  716 tests pass, CI green, door_classify two-way. Not yet checked by anyone: a
  real display sleep with the fix in place. Merged 4 Oct, deploy pending.

### Thu 1 Oct and Fri 2 Oct: #120 and #121

- **#126 search keeps a reply that matches your own.** Greyforge Labs
  (github.com/GreyforgeLabs, new contributor; X https://x.com/GreyforgeLabs,
  published on the GitHub profile). In a group, your "yes" and another
  member's "yes" in the same second showed as one search hit, because
  search's echo key ignored the sender; a note to yourself could show as
  incoming. Search now reuses the echo rules the conversation view already
  had. Verified: all four new tests fail on the old code, 676 pass with the
  PR. Measured on Fred's Mac, four queries of 400 rows each: every other
  conversation's hits are identical before and after. **Our follow-up:** his
  self-thread holds 3 or 4 incoming copies of each note (iCloud re-sync), and
  search answers newest first, so one copy still survived as an incoming
  hit; search now hands outgoing rows to the dedupe first. Query "test":
  340 hits before, 286 with the PR, 196 with the follow-up. Not seen in live
  data: the same-second group case itself, which only the tests cover.

- **#116 + #117 outbound tapbacks (closes #69).** Erik Fillipsveen
  (github.com/Fileri). Pick a tapback in the message menu and the Mac
  performs it on that exact bubble through Accessibility, with SIP on;
  chat.db is the referee. Off unless `tapbacks=on`; groups refused; no new
  permission prompt. Before merging we fixed the one review finding
  ourselves (1fbc737): an identical message at the same time of day on a
  LATER day could take the reaction, because the transcript shows HH:MM
  only. 709 tests; deployed everywhere, switched off by default.

- **#120 read state syncs through a durable, verified queue.** Damon Janis
  (https://x.com/damonjanis), replaces his #103. Every read is saved before
  any Mac call, retried with backoff, and retired only when chat.db confirms
  it. Merged 1 Oct with Fred's OK, deployed 2 Oct with the new Mac bridge.
  Watcher-alive poll restored from 10 s to 60 s; the per-poll snapshot cost
  and a blocking 180 s Mac call are open in #125.
- **#121 Mark as Unread / Mark as Read.** Damon again. Right-click or U;
  DMs through Messages' own menu item, verified in chat.db; groups local.
  672 tests green; deployed gus, vic and the Mac bridge.

### Wed 30 Sep: three merges, two reviews

- **#124 blip-setup kept host=192.168.x.x intact.** Chad Stovern (github.com/chadhs,
  new contributor; X https://x.com/chadstovern, confirmed on the PR). `tr -d '"\x27 '` is not
  a hex escape to tr, so it deleted every 2, 7 and x from bridge.conf values:
  host=chadhs@192.168.110.106 came back as 19.168.110.106 and was written back,
  so every re-run failed. Reproduced both halves by hand before merging.
- **#123 Up/Down in the compose field keep the selected bubble.** Erik
  Fillipsveen (github.com/Fileri), closes #118 as agreed with Jon Kinney.
- **#119 one sentence in CLAUDE.md again.** Ian Swope (https://x.com/ianfs).
- **Our own:** CI was red on main from 26 to 30 Sep because the voice-message
  change read a column one test fixture did not have; the file is named
  `*_test.py` and was never in my local run. Fixed, all 15 bridge test files
  now run by both name patterns.
- **In review, changes requested:** Erik's tapbacks (#116/#117, answers #69):
  opt-in, no new prompts, 673 + 146 tests green, one cross-day wrong-message
  case to close first. Damon Janis's read-sync series (#120-#122, replaces
  #103): sound design; a focus bug in Pin/Mute, a per-poll cost, blocking
  Mac calls and an unhealthy state on old bridges to fix.

## 2026-W39 (Mon 21 Sep to Sun 27 Sep): post due Sun 27 Sep

4 PRs merged so far, from 3 people.

### Fri 25 Sep: two merges, both Guido

- **#115 opt-in glide for mouse-wheel notches.** Guido Jouret again
  (github.com/gjouret; X https://x.com/gjouret), filed the same afternoon
  as #114 merged. With `smooth_scroll=on` in bridge.conf a wheel notch glides
  180 ms (OutCubic) to its place instead of landing at once; a notch that
  arrives mid-glide moves the target rather than restarting the easing, so a
  fast spin keeps its full distance; keys, paging, the bottom-stick, the
  scrollbar and any touchpad event cancel it; image growth above the
  viewport carries a running glide along. Touchpads never animate. **What
  changed in the merge:** the PR shipped the glide ON for everyone behind a
  shell.json setting and rewrote the "never animate wheel scroll" invariant.
  Fred chose opt-in, default off, as a bridge.conf key, for two reasons:
  bridge.conf is Blip's one config surface, and the invariant came from his
  own MX Master, whose single click is four notches in 0.13 s (measured
  today), while Guido tested on a plain wheel and an offscreen Qt Quick Test
  harness only. Fred had approved the direct feel at scroll_gain=0.25 an hour
  before the PR arrived; the default flips on his hand, not on a harness.
  632 tests green; deployed on gus and vic with the key absent, so nothing
  changed for anyone yet. Not verified: the glide on real hardware here.
  Next pass: Fred runs `smooth_scroll=on` on gus for a few days.

- **#114 one wheel notch scrolls one notch, not half a screen.** Guido Jouret
  (github.com/gjouret; X https://x.com/gjouret, declared on his GitHub
  profile, name matches). The conversation and the thread list multiplied
  every wheel event by 4.5, so a standard notch (angleDelta 120) moved about
  540 px, and touchpad deltas by 3, on top of the scroll factor Hyprland had
  already applied. Blip was the one app on the desktop scrolling 4.5× faster
  than everything else, and anyone who tuned `input:scroll_factor` got that
  tuning multiplied only here. Both handlers now apply the delta 1:1 through
  two BlipView properties (`wheelMultiplier`, `touchpadMultiplier`, default
  1.0). The 4.5 dated from Fred's own 1.3.4 scroll fix, where the real bugs
  were a WheelHandler that never fired, chips growing above the viewport and
  Repeater rebuilds; the gain was never measured against another app. Fred
  chose 1:1 over keeping the old defaults and judges the feel by hand; if it
  is too slow the next step is a bridge.conf key, not a constant. Deployed on
  gus and vic with the merge, shell logs clean on both: the MX Master 4 goes
  from 540 to 120 px per notch, the laptop touchpad (scroll_factor 0.4) from
  1.2 to 0.4 px per px. Still `MouseArea.onWheel`, unanimated, and the
  conversation still goes through `scrollConversation()`, so the bottom-stick
  is untouched. 630 tests green; a new test pins both handlers and fails
  against the old file. Not verified by hand: touchpad feel (Guido has no
  touchpad on his machine; Fred's Elan is the first real test).

- **Follow-up the same afternoon: `scroll_gain=` in bridge.conf (direct,
  Fred / Larry).** Fred's first hand test came back "way too fast, a whole
  page per click". A raw evdev capture of the MX Master 4 showed why: one
  physical click of that wheel is FOUR notches (bursts of 4, 4, 4, 3 in 0.13 s
  each), so even at 1:1 one click is 480 px in a 609 px window. Rather than
  put a constant back, `scroll_gain=` and `touchpad_scroll_gain=` (0.05–10,
  default 1, re-read on save, reported by `status`) went in as bridge.conf
  keys per the config rule, and gus and vic run 0.25: one click ≈ 120 px.
  Guido's 1:1 default stands for everyone else. 631 tests.
  **Correction to the two entries above.** The "deployed on gus and vic"
  claims for #113 and #114 were not true until 25 Sep. The #113 deploy on
  23 Sep left its backup as `nixfred.blip.bak-113-<ts>` INSIDE
  `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/` on both hosts; the registry scans that folder
  in glob order and the last manifest with an id wins, so the backup (the
  pre-#113 build) was what actually ran, on both machines, while three
  deploys reported `healthy=true`. Found because `status` never printed the
  new `scroll_gain=` field the file on disk contained. Fred's "too fast" test
  was therefore the OLD 4.5× code (2160 px per click), never Guido's 1:1.
  Backups now live in `~/.local/state/omarchy/plugin-backups/`; CLAUDE.md's
  deploy recipe says so. Brad's #113 fix and Guido's #114 are live on both
  hosts as of 25 Sep, verified by the `scroll_gain=0.25` field in `status`.
  Fred's hand verdict the same evening: "I like the scrolling." 0.25 stays
  on gus and vic; nothing left to tune here.

### Wed 23 Sep: one merge

- **#113 turning the monitor off no longer takes Hyprland down.** Brad Larson
  (github.com/followbl; X https://x.com/followbl, confirmed by Brad on
  #113, 2026-09-26). With the Blip window open,
  powering off the only monitor, or a DisplayPort monitor dropping off when
  it sleeps (his Samsung C49HG9x), segfaulted Hyprland 0.56.2 on four separate
  nights. Qt swaps the lost output for a placeholder screen with no name and
  no size, Omarchy builds a bar on it, and Blip's widget on that bar crowned
  itself leader and restored the app window, mapped with nowhere to put it.
  The leader rule moved into a pure TypeScript module (`screen-leader.ts`,
  built to `ScreenLeader.mjs`) and a widget now leads only on a real screen.
  Verified here in Test Drive on the same Hyprland 0.56.2 / Quickshell 0.3.1:
  an instrumented build showed the placeholder arriving as `["",0,0]` and the
  new rule answering `leader=false` with no window, where the old rule led
  and mapped one (its second IPC handler showed up in the shell log). Not
  verified: the segfault itself. Hyprland in the VM stands up a FALLBACK
  output in the same event, so the window landed there; Brad's DisplayPort
  race is what leaves Hyprland with no output at all. gus logged the same
  placeholder event twice on 20 Sep. Deployed on gus and vic with the merge.
  Trade-off he accepted: no polling or toasts while there is no screen, and
  nothing could show them anyway.

### Tue 22 Sep: one merge

- **#111 the deploy recipe in CLAUDE.md stops dropping files.** Ian Swope (no
  verified X handle). Four stale facts, two of which silently cost working
  features on any machine deployed by following it: the `cp` line left out
  `otp-desktop.py`, which the autofill helper spawns from the installed plugin
  directory, and the shim list stopped at four names when `blip-setup` has
  installed a fifth, `contact-save`, since #91. It was not hypothetical here.
  vic had been taken from 2.5.0 to 2.6.1 with that exact recipe on 20 Sep, so
  its helper was still the 2.5.0 copy and #110's Zen/Firefox fix never reached
  it. Neither gus nor vic had `contact-save`, so Save-as-contact failed on both,
  and all five shims on both machines dated from 1 Sep. Fixed on both machines
  with the merge. Verified: `contact-save` now reaches the Mac and gets the
  tool's own refusal for empty input, where it used to be refused locally with
  exit 64, and `imsg` still exits 0 through the refreshed shim.
- Not merged, for the record: Ian also filed #112. Chrome, and Blink generally,
  never exposes HTML `autocomplete` over AT-SPI, so security-code detection on
  Chromium-family browsers is label-only. Left open on purpose (Fred,
  2026-09-22). A missed label still gets the weaker "Select a field, then fill"
  prompt; it is not silent.

## 2026-W38 (Mon 14 Sep to Sun 20 Sep): OPEN, post due Sun 20 Sep

27 PRs merged so far, from 8 people.

### Mon 15 Sep: ten merges, the Codex-audit backlog cleared

- **#80 stamps cross the bridge as UTC, local time is a display concern.** Zach
  Wilke, https://x.com/zachwilke_1. Reported by cjoh (GitHub, no handle found).
  The Mac's naive clock compared against a Linux clock meant nothing counted as
  unread one way and the backlog re-toasted the other, and in the DST fall-back
  hour two messages an hour apart carried the same stamp. Consequence for
  anyone still on an old bridge: stamps are normalised at the two fetch doors,
  so a half-upgraded pair keeps working.
- **#81 animated GIFs arrive as their own bytes.** Zach Wilke. The Mac
  resampled every image with sips, so a 1.4 MB GIF reached Linux as a 198 KB
  still, motion gone before the panel saw it.
- **#82 a message carries every file you drop.** Zach Wilke. Dropping five
  photos attached one and discarded four silently. Capped at ten, caption on
  the first part only.
- **#84 docs: outbound tapbacks are half possible on macOS 26.** Zach Wilke.
  Menu items exist and are scriptable; what is unsolved is selecting a bubble
  remotely. Do not quote the old "impossible" note.
- **#75 a 3-4 digit short code is a DM, not a group.** Ian Swope (no verified X
  handle). 611 and 2536 opened read-only, so you could not reply STOP.
- **#76 no toast for the conversation you already have open.** Ian Swope.
- **#77 README allowlist and mutelist examples now parse.** Ian Swope. Copied as
  shown, they configured nothing and said nothing.
- **#85 follower bars stop toasting on every extra monitor.** Ian Swope. Docked
  to two externals, every message fired three toasts. Every bar crowned itself
  leader for the first few hundred ms after a hotplug.
- **#88 the panel no longer hangs half-faded.** Ian Swope. Measured with a
  frame-gap probe: 441 to 627 ms of blocked GUI thread per open, because the
  list rendered all 300 rows when ten are on screen.
- **#87 the app window stays on its workspace after idle.** Danny Cecil,
  https://x.com/jefehoser.

### Tue 16 Sep: four merges

- **#95 a message read on another device never toasts.** Ian Swope, fixing #89
  reported by Marshall Huss, https://x.com/mwhuss. Waking the laptop replayed
  the night as up to twenty toasts, including messages already read on the
  iPhone.
- **#93 Super+M only ever touches the real Blip window.** Danny Cecil,
  https://x.com/jefehoser. It matched any title starting with "Blip", so a
  browser tab called "Blip documentation" got closed instead. Users must
  re-copy the binding from the README; updating the plugin cannot change a
  Hyprland config.
- **#94 right-click a message to quote or copy it.** Danny Cecil. Behaviour
  change worth flagging in the post: right-click on text used to copy
  instantly, now it opens a menu.
- **#92 a security code offered beside the field that wants it.** Brenden
  Bishop, https://x.com/bbishdotdev. Opt in with `otp_autofill=on`. Tested in a
  VM before merge: the labelled field and six separate digit boxes both filled,
  a field labelled Message got no prompt, the clipboard never held a code. Be
  honest in the post: a plain unlabelled field gets a manual prompt and a click
  puts the code there, which is documented design, not a defect.

### Wed 17 Sep: five merges

- **#98 one never-opened unread no longer slows every poll.** Ian Swope. The
  fetch boundary was one global minimum, so a single dot nobody opened set the
  depth for every poll: 150 rows doubling to 8192 across that many sequential
  ssh calls. His measurement, a 45-day dot: 6 calls, 4798 rows, 3.18 s against a
  6 s timer. Re-measured here on a crafted six-week-old dot against the live
  bridge, twice each: 1.8 s to 0.63 s, same unread count. Follow-up left open
  and worth saying out loud: `imsg thread` bounds by rows, not date, so a
  `--since` on the bridge would make each of these one exact call.
- **#101 a read dot no longer returns while the badge says zero.** Damon Janis,
  https://x.com/damonjanis. The no-op cache did not move when an optimistic
  read mutated the model. First real QML regression test in the repo: it runs
  the shipping bar code under Qt, 6 pass, and 2 fail against the old code
  (verified both ways here).
- **#102 a read push is done only when the Mac's count reaches zero.** Damon
  Janis. 3 to 2 exited 0, and so did "cannot verify". Trade-off for the post: a
  message landing inside the three-second settle now reports failure for a push
  that cleared what it could. Neither of us tested it live, because that means
  marking every conversation read on a real account.
- **#96 `prefer_imessage=on` keeps a mixed 1:1 on iMessage.** Baden,
  https://x.com/badenpiland. One RCS inbound turned every later send green and the
  Mac logged SMS error 4 while the iPhone had delivered. Off by default. Say
  plainly: an old successful iMessage counts, so a contact who moved to Android
  is tried on iMessage until a send fails.
- **#99 CLAUDE.md records rank-then-size for contact sources.** Ian Swope,
  catching our own note going stale the same day the code changed.

### Fri 18 Sep: four merges, one fix of ours

- **#104 one Linux-shim line in the shape diagram.** Ian Swope (no verified X
  handle). Our own bin_dir merge left two versions of the same line, one
  already stale. He caught it the same day.
- **#106 a group read reaches the Mac.** Jon Kinney, https://x.com/jondkinney.
  Per-thread read push was DMs only because a group id has no `imessage://`
  form. Messages has a second deep link, `imessage:open?groupid=`, so a group
  read in Blip now clears on the phone with `push_read=thread`. This overturns
  our own "a group cannot be addressed at all" note. VERIFIED LIVE here on
  macOS 27 before merging: opened a real group by URL and read back Messages'
  front window title, which was the group's participant list, then restored the
  front app. Not tested end to end, because that marks a real conversation read
  on a live account.
- **#105 a source-routing seam, and nothing else changes.** David Reinecke
  (github dreinecke, no verified X handle). Every per-conversation spawn asks
  which bridge answers for that id; stock Blip has one source and resolves
  exactly as before, pinned by tests. Fred agreed to the seam alone on #70 with
  the contributor's second messenger staying in his fork. Checked here:
  SourceId.mjs is byte-identical to a fresh build of source-id.ts, and a live
  collector run on the branch gave the same counts as main.
- **bin_dir= really moves every shim now.** Found by Kb2uka (github, no
  verified handle) while rebasing #91: exact-card details and vCard export
  still called ~/bin/contacts directly, so moving the shims broke both. The
  guard test missed it because its regex matched only double quotes and two
  tool names. Fixed and widened on main (4134bbf), separately from his PR, so
  the fix is not waiting on a feature review.

- **#108 a read push counts the whole conversation, not one chat row.** Ian
  Swope. imsg-read verified with an exact match on one chat row, but Messages
  splits a conversation across rows: with the unread on an alias it printed
  "nothing unread" and silently never pushed, and settle() agreed. This is our
  own cluster invariant that the verification was not following, and it sits
  directly on #102's "the count is the referee". Not reproducible on our own
  Mac (no identifier there currently has more than one row); his tests carry it.

### Sat 20 Sep: 2.6.0 and 2.6.1

- **2.6.0 cut**, 27 PRs this week from 8 people. Headline: security codes fill
  themselves, an unknown sender can be saved as a contact, right-click quotes a
  reply, a group read in Blip clears the phone, Send Later shows as Scheduled,
  GIFs arrive as GIFs, stamps cross the bridge as UTC.
- **2.6.1, our own fix, found while verifying #109.** Every follower-to-leader
  forward ran `qs -p /usr/share/omarchy/shell`, and `qs` matches instances by
  config path, so on any machine running the shell from a checkout
  (`omarchy dev link`, which is this one) all six forwards exited 255 with
  "No running instances". The shell's own summon still returned ok, so a second
  monitor's bar icon and its hotkey did nothing and said nothing. Four of the
  six calls predate #109; joshhattan's two matched the house style and were
  right to. Now `Quickshell.shellDir`, which IS the stock path on a stock box.
  Worth saying plainly: #109 was correct and its own test passed, and the
  feature was still inert here. A guard test now fails on any re-hardcoded path,
  and it was checked against the old file to prove it can fail.

### Fri 19 Sep: two merges

- **#110 the security code fills in Zen and Firefox.** joshhattan (github, no
  handle published; asked on the PR how he wants to be credited). Clicking
  "Fill code" in Zen did nothing and said nothing: Gecko's accessibility layer
  returns success from `set_text_contents()` and writes nothing, and the helper
  returned straight after the call without ever reading the field back. It now
  re-reads, and types the code through the same Hyprland key path Chromium
  already uses when the field is still empty; a write that did land keeps the
  early return, so the digits are never entered twice. Verified here on the
  merge: 621 bun tests and 8 python tests green, and his new fallback test
  fails on main without the change. NOT reproduced on our own screen, because
  neither Zen nor Firefox is the browser here; his evidence is a live sign-in
  page in Zen 1.22.2b plus a test page counting `input` events. One thing left
  open for him: Gecko's write is synchronous, so a late-landing write plus the
  typed keys would double the code, and nothing re-checks between the two.

- **#109 a window you move stays put, and the popout follows the icon you
  clicked.** joshhattan (github, no handle published; asked on the PR, still
  open). Three fixes in one PR. The first is the good one: `sameAddress()`
  compared the window's own address, `0x5b1604b31bf0`, against the address
  Hyprland puts on the event socket, `5b1604b31bf0`, as plain strings. They
  never matched, so the `reason: "move"` path added by #87 was dead code from
  the day it shipped and `strayReturn` undid every deliberate move about 400 ms
  later. Nothing covered it: the #87 devlog proved a stray move is returned but
  never that a real move is saved, and `ui.test.ts` only asserted the string
  `sameAddress` existed. Both address formats confirmed here on gus against
  socket2 and `hyprctl clients`. The other two are the multi-monitor bar: only
  the first screen's widget owns a panel, so a click on any other bar, and
  `SUPER+CTRL+<n>` on any other screen, went to the leader's copy or nowhere at
  all, silently, with the shell counting it as success. Followers now forward
  their screen name, and the leader re-anchors the panel to that bar. He chose
  a separate open-only verb (`openon`, not `toggleon`) so a hotkey meaning
  "open" cannot close a panel that is already up, which is the right call and
  meshes with Omarchy's own routing: `BarModel.pickPanelSlot` prefers an open
  copy, so the next press still reaches the leader and closes it. Verified here
  by deploying onto the live shell and driving every verb, plus a screenshot.
  NOT verified here: gus has one monitor attached, so the follower path was
  only exercised through IPC, not across two physical bars. His DP-1/DP-2
  testing carries that half. His base was three commits old, so it was
  cherry-picked onto current main first; only CHANGELOG conflicted. 622 tests
  green.

### Waiting on people, Fri 18 Sep
- **#103** Damon Janis, https://x.com/damonjanis: CI failed on a GitHub 504
  downloading bun, nothing to do with his code; re-triggered. Now conflicts
  with #106 in the same helper, so it needs a rebase. Fred answered his open
  question: the badge counts unread CONVERSATIONS, as he proposed.
- **#91 MERGED** Kb2uka (no verified handle, asked on the PR): saving a NEW
  contact to the Mac. Breaks our "nothing is ever written to Contacts"
  invariant, so Fred decided it after a full read of the write path: create
  only (no delete or modify path exists in the helper), duplicate-refusing,
  reads the card back before reporting success, handle must match the saved
  identity, fields on stdin, fails closed without the Contacts grant. Not
  exercised live: creating a real contact needs the prompt answered at the Mac.
- **#83** Zach Wilke, https://x.com/zachwilke_1: no movement since 15 Sep,
  still conflicting with an unanswered review. Nudged, offered to close it.
- **#25** Jon Kinney: gated contact writes, still a draft; Fred's full review
  is on the PR and the delete path is refused.

### Ours this week, for context in the post, not credit
- Blip 2.5.0 shipped Sun 13 Sep.
- A waiting Send Later message showed as already sent and became a
  conversation's newest message; fixed 16 Sep. Found checking macOS 27.
- Everything Blip taught us about the Mac helpers went upstream as
  claude-on-mac v2.0.0 (16 Sep), including the group-send -1728 fix, macOS 26
  unsend detection, region-aware phone matching and UTC stamps.
- macOS 27 (27.0, 26A428) verified: every read path, contacts, photos, sending.
- vic ran an old Blip against the updated bridge and showed every message at
  12:00am. Our miss, not a contributor's: a bridge change has to reach every
  client in the same step.

- **The app window opens where you are (1b148f8, ours).** Blip's home-workspace
  restore (#87) claimed a home from wherever the window first landed and then
  restored onto it even when that workspace was gone, so Hyprland created it and
  moved the reader there; plonk renumbered it underneath. Now only a deliberate
  move claims a home, and a dead home is ignored. Traced on Hyprland's event
  socket, which is the quickest way to see this class of bug. Not a contributor
  issue, and worth a line in the post because anyone running a workspace
  compactor would hit it.

### Handles Fred still needs to answer (asked 2026-09-18)
- **Brad Larson** (github.com/followbl, #113), asked 2026-09-23. Nothing
  published on GitHub or his site metaintro.com. https://x.com/followbl has
  the same unique login and the same name, 905 followers, posts about AI
  models; no Omarchy/Blip/@NixFred post in the 7-day window. Likely him.
  Untagged until Fred answers; do not guess.
- **Ian Swope** (github.com/ianswope), 12 merged PRs, the most of anyone this
  week. Nothing published; @IanSwope on X carries his name but is dormant with
  no tie to Linux or GitHub. FRED IS ASKING HIM (2026-09-18). Untagged until he
  answers; do not guess.
- **Jethro Jones**: ANSWERED 2026-09-18, tag https://x.com/jethrojones.
- **cw228** (#100), **Kb2uka** (#90, #91) and **cjoh** (reported #86): asked on
  their own PRs/issue 2026-09-18 how they want to be credited, with "rather not
  be tagged" offered as an equally good answer. Waiting.
- **joshhattan** (#110, merged 19 Sep): nothing published at all, not even a
  real name (the GitHub profile name is "kj3h4g5"). Asked on the PR. Fred's
  call 2026-09-19 was to log "none found" and revisit at post time.
- **tolewis**, **jacobaross**, **apexbenny**,
  **dreinecke**, **znayer**, **Erik Fillipsveen**: nothing published, and Erik
  is the largest contributor to the project overall.

### Standing items to mention when they resolve
- Ian Swope has 12 merged PRs and no X handle anyone can verify. If someone
  knows it, we tag him properly.
- #83 (Zach Wilke, hold the Mac channel open) is still blocked on the socket
  ownership review and conflicts with main.
- #100 (cw228, `bin_dir=`) conflicts with main.
- #90 and #91 (Kb2uka, delete messages, save contacts) are still drafts.
